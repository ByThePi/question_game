# question_game
a project to practice basics of python and writing a clean code, actually mostly done for fun and out of boredom

the challenging part of this code was, while printing the letters in an alphabetical order also printing the answers next to letters in a random order each time.
this concept basically provides a little bit of security, preventing the answers being in the same order every time.
